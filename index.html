          <p><strong>Slow motion</strong> (commonly abbreviated as slo-mo or slow-mo) is an effect in film-making whereby time appears to be slowed down. 
                It was invented by the Austrian priest August Musger in the early 20th century</p>
          <p>Typically this style is achieved when each film frame is captured at a rate much faster than it will be played back. 
               When replayed at normal speed, time appears to be moving more slowly. 
               A term for creating slow motion film is <b>overcranking</b> which refers to hand cranking an early camera
               at a faster rate than normal (i.e. faster than 24 frames per second).</p>
